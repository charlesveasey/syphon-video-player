# .gitignore file for Xcode4 / OS X Source projects
#
# Version 2.0
#    For latest version, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects
#
# 2013 updates:
#    - fixed the broken "save personal Schemes"
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
#   and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
#   files that we want to exclude
#
#########################
 
#####
# OS X temporary files that should never be committed
 
.DS_Store
*.swp
*.lock
profile
 
 
####
# Xcode temporary files that should never be committed
# 
# NB: NIB/XIB files still exist even on Storyboard projects, so we want this...
 
*~.nib
 
 
####
# Xcode build files -
#
# NB: slash on the end, so we only remove the FOLDER, not any files that were badly named "DerivedData"
 
DerivedData/
 
# NB: slash on the end, so we only remove the FOLDER, not any files that were badly named "build"
 
build/
 
 
#####
# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)
#
# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"
 
*.pbxuser
*.mode1v3
*.mode2v3
*.perspectivev3
#    NB: also, whitelist the default ones, some projects need to use these
!default.pbxuser
!default.mode1v3
!default.mode2v3
!default.perspectivev3
 
 
####
# Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings
#
#
# OPTION 1: ---------------------------------
#     throw away ALL personal settings (including custom schemes!
#     - unless they are "shared")
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 2 below
xcuserdata
 
# OPTION 2: ---------------------------------
#     get rid of ALL personal settings, but KEEP SOME OF THEM
#     - NB: you must manually uncomment the bits you want to keep
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 1 above
#
#xcuserdata/**/*
 
#     (requires option 2 above): Personal Schemes
#
#!xcuserdata/**/xcschemes/*
 
####
# XCode 4 workspaces - more detailed
#
# Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't exclude them :)
#
# Workspace layout is quite spammy. For reference:
#
# /(root)/
#   /(project-name).xcodeproj/
#     project.pbxproj
#     /project.xcworkspace/
#       contents.xcworkspacedata
#       /xcuserdata/
#         /(your name)/xcuserdatad/
#           UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate
#     /xcsshareddata/
#       /xcschemes/
#         (shared scheme name).xcscheme
#     /xcuserdata/
#       /(your name)/xcuserdatad/
#         (private scheme).xcscheme
#         xcschememanagement.plist
#

####
# Xcode 4 - Deprecated classes
#
# Allegedly, if you manually "deprecate" your classes, they get moved here.
#
# We're using source-control, so this is a "feature" that we do not want!
 
*.moved-aside

# UNKNOWN: recommended by others, but I can't discover what these files are
#
# ...none. Everything is now explained.

 adamgit commented 4 months ago
Done. Sorry, forgot to add at the time

 marzapower commented 3 months ago
I suggest adding these lines, for those who currently use CocoaPods:

Pods/
Podfile.lock

 adamgit commented 3 months ago
@marzapower thanks, updated with your comments from the SO answer

 rais38 commented 23 days ago
Podfile.lock contains the pod commit SHAs that just got installed so that you can easily restore that exact environment later on other machines (very important in teams). I think that this file must be removed from .gitignore

 matej commented 20 days ago
I agree with @rais38, Podfile.lock should not be ignored any longer. See this issue for details.

It actually even needs to be explicitly allowed (by changing Podfile.lock to !Podfile.lock), so it does not get added by the *.lock declaration.

 tvon commented 11 days ago
 on removing the Podfile.lock (and the *.lock line, Gemfile.lock is important if it exists).
